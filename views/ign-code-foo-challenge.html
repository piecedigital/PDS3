				In April of 2015 IGN presented various coding challenges to be completed by the first of May. These challeges were to be treated essentially as our application to be a part of their internship program.
				<br><br>
				I unfortunately did not pass the second round of applicants but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and opportunity to work on interesting algorith and API challenges.
				<br><br>
				Linked below is the completed API challenge given, and also my Github repo containing the API challenge and the algorithm challenge (also the Readme.md contains my answers to their given questions).
