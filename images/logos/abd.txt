The inspiration for this logo was Pokemon.

I didn't want to stick with the typical choice of real life creatures; I wanted to do something slightly different. What inspired me to do this was the Dignitas logo. It made me think of Pokemon which then inspired the the design.

I kept it simple, as simple as a circle could get; I decided to keep the details inside of it. I wanted to design something that looked like it would normally be cute but wanted to be threatening (like Pokemon).

The color blue gives it the option of being either cute or threating(-ish) due to the association of blue with water and sometimes electricity.
