The inspiration for this logo was the name of the clan.

This logo was created for me and a buddy of mine. We had plans to  start a new Call of Duty clan. It didn't work out but it was good practice none the less.

The biggest challenge for me was to figure out a cool design but I wanted to incorporate the name in the logo itself. Judge for yourself but I do believe I was able to fit the entire name into this logo.

The inspiration for the design was hell... yes, the firey place where the Devil live (or Hades, whomever you prefer). It gives of this slightly evil look that I thought was really nice.
