The inspiration for this logo was insanity.
<br><br>
Though I aspire to do as few eagle mascot logos as possible, as there are so many of them out there already, I decided I would try my mind at one but twist it a bit... literally. There are many eagle mascot logos out there but not many have deranged eagles(I have yet to see another crazy, or deranged eagle).

I gave the eagle a twisted look to emphasize the deranged characteristic. The twisted mouth, asymmentrical eyes, the slight detail of the head not being completely straight up I believe really sell the deranged theme of this logo.
