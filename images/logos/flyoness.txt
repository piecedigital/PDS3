The inspiration for this logo was the calm yet aggressive look that a Lioness gives off, so in this logo I attempted to capture that.

In my observation of various images of Lioness' I noticed how very smooth and streamline their fur was, so I avoided overdoing fur details and stuck to subtle yet noticeable tufts of fur.
Smooth and streamline, the key words that inspired the design down to the choice of having no feet but a tail of the body instead.
