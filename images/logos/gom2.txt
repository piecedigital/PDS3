Gods of Mayhem being an eSports-related brand meant that I needed to create a sporty logo to fit the name, breand and idea behind them.

Mayhem was an obvious inspiration for obvious reasons and I decided that it needed to be incorporated somehow. So I that meant I needed to create a character that looked like they might carry that sort of characteristic of being chaotic and destructive.

League of Legends also attributed to the inspiration of the character. More specifically, the "Warriors" music video created for the 2014 LoL World Championships. If you watch the Warriors video and then the extended logo you might see how it inspired.
