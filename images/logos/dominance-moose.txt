The inspiration for this logo was pure dominance.
<br><br>
When deciding what animal I wanted to go with I wanted to go with something that could easily display an image of dominance and match it up with a symbol of one as well. The antlers were perfect for that as my only other option was a bull (and there are too many bull mascots out there).
<br><br>
I did some research and located a symbol for dominance, which I decided to place behind the Moose, creating a star-like symmetry.

The color red invokes the emotion of rage, or a posture of aggression, the latter of which is mainly why I went with red.
