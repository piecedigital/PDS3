The inspiration for this logo was... I honestly can't recall but it inspired something pretty cool!
<br><br>
Creating a logo in b/w first was not something I had really thought about but I learned shortly priot that a logo should be able to work in both b-w and in color. When I was created this logo the main thing that I tried to accomplish was creating someting that worked in primarily b/w.

The Rebal theme just came to me as I was deciding what to design based around a shield. Having the shield upside down to emphasize the "rebeleous" theme of the logo.
